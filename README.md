## File Structure

```bash
├── index.html               # Main HTML file
├── styles.css               # CSS file for styling
├── script.js                # JavaScript file for quiz logic

```

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the quiz app.
- **styles.css**: Includes the styling for the quiz elements.

## How It Works

1. The quiz presents a set of questions, each with four answer options.

3. The selected answer is marked as green if correct and red if incorrect.
4. After answering a question, the user can click the **Next** button to proceed.
5. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed with the option to restart.
